            <h1><strong>Risk Factors of Cancer </strong></h1>
            <p>There are various factors that increase the risk of developing cancer, including:</p>
            <ul class="risk-list">
                <li><b>Smoking and tobacco use</b></li>
                <p>Are major risk factors for various types of cancer, most notably lung cancer. Tobacco contains carcinogens that damage DNA, increasing the risk of cancers of the pancreas, bladder, and esophagus, among others. Even secondhand smoke can increase cancer risk for non-smokers, making tobacco use one of the most preventable causes of cancer</p>

                <li><b>Excessive alcohol consumption</b></li>
                <p>Is a significant risk factor for several types of cancer, like liver. Alcohol damage DNA, promote inflammation, and increase levels of certain hormones, all of which contribute to cancer development. The more alcohol consumed, the higher the risk, with even moderate drinking increasing the likelihood of certain cancers.</p>

                <li><b>Unhealthy diet and lack of physical activity</b></li>
                <p>Are major risk factors for cancer. A diet high in processed foods, red meats, and unhealthy fats can lead to obesity, which is associated with an increased risk of cancer. Additionally, physical inactivity contributes to weight gain and poor overall health, further raising the risk of cancer. A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and regular exercise can help reduce this risk.</p>

                <li><b>Exposure to radiation and harmful chemicals</b></li>
                <p>Exposure to radiation and harmful chemicals is a well-established risk factor for cancer. Ionizing radiation, such as that from X-rays, can damage DNA, leading to mutations that may result in cancers like leukemia, lung, or thyroid cancer. Similarly, exposure to harmful chemicals, such as benzene, or industrial solvents, increases the risk of cancers.</p>
                <li><b>Family history</b></li>
                <p>Family history is an important risk factor for cancer, as certain types of cancer can run in families due to shared genetic mutations. If close relatives, such as parents or siblings, have had cancer, it may indicate a higher likelihood of inheriting genetic changes that increase the risk of developing the same or related cancers. A strong family history, especially of cancers like breast, colon, or ovarian, may lead to earlier screenings or genetic testing to assess individual risk and catch cancer early.</p>
                <li><b>Infections like HPV and Hepatitis</b></li>
                <p>Are significant risk factors for certain types of cancer. HPV,it lead to cancers of the cervix, and genital areas. Chronic Hepatitis B and C infections can increase the risk of liver cancer. These infections cause long-term cellular changes or inflammation that can lead to cancer development.</p>
