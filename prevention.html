            <p>There are several ways to lower your risk of developing cancer...</p>
            <ul class="prevention-list">
                <li><b>Stop smoking</b></li>
                <p>if you smoke, quit. If you don’t smoke don’t start. Smoking is linked to several types of cancer not just lung cancer. Stopping now will reduce your risk of cancer in the future.</p>

                <li><b>Maintain a healthy diet</b></li>
                <p>choose a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Select whole grains and lean proteins. Limit your intake of processed meats.</p>

                <li><b>Engage in regular physical activity</b></li>
                <p>Engaging in regular physical activity is a key preventive measure against cancer, as it helps maintain a healthy weight, boosts the immune system, and reduces inflammation. Exercise can also regulate hormone levels, such as estrogen and insulin, which are linked to cancer risk. Consistent physical activity, like walking, swimming, or strength training, lowers the risk of several cancers, including breast, colon, and lung cancer</p>
                <li><b>Avoid tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption</b></li>
                <p>Tobacco use is linked to multiple cancers, including lung, while alcohol increases the risk of cancers like liver. Reducing or eliminating these habits significantly lowers the risk of developing cancer and supports overall health.</p>
                <li><b>Get regular medical checkups and screenings</b></li>
                <p>Is essential for early cancer detection and prevention. Routine screenings, such as mammograms, colonoscopies, and Pap smears, can help detect cancers before symptoms appear, improving the chances of successful treatment. Regular checkups also allow doctors to monitor risk factors and offer personalized advice on reducing cancer risk</p>
                <li><b>Maintaining healthy weight</b></li>
                <p>As excess body fat, particularly abdominal fat, can increase the risk of several cancers, including breast, colon, and pancreatic cancer. Being overweight or obese can lead to higher levels of hormones like estrogen and insulin, which promote cancer cell growth. Regular physical activity and a balanced diet are key factors in achieving and maintaining a healthy weight.</p>
