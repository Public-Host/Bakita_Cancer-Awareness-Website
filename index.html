                <h2>What is Cancer?</h2>
                <p>
                    Cancer is a term used to describe a group of diseases that occur when abnormal cells in the body begin to divide uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. These cells can form tumors (a mass of tissue), or they can spread through the blood and lymph systems to other organs. Cancer can affect any part of the body and is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cancer, it can start almost anywhere in the human body which is composed of trillion of cells. Normally human cell grows and divide to form a new cell as needed, and when they become damaged, they die. However, cancer disrupts this orderly process, leading to the formation of tumors that can invade nearby tissue and metastasize to distance parts of the body.

                <h2>How cancer grows</h2>
                <p>
                    Cancer grows when normal cells in the body undergo genetic mutations that cause them to grow and divide uncontrollably. Normally, the body's cells follow a regulated cycle of growth, division, and death. However, when mutations occur in the DNA, especially in genes that control cell growth and repair (such as tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes), this balance is disrupted. As a result, cancerous cells evade the normal signals that tell them when to stop dividing or die, leading to excessive cell proliferation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These abnormal cells can form a mass or tumor, and over time, they may invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system. This spread is known as metastasis. Tumors may also develop the ability to create their own blood supply through a process called angiogenesis, which provides the tumor with the nutrients and oxygen it needs to continue growing. The uncontrolled growth and spread of cancer cells make cancer a serious, often life-threatening disease.

      <div class="accordion-body">Skin cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the skin cells, often caused by damage to the DNA in skin cells due to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds. There are three main types: basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Basal and squamous cell cancers are more common and tend to be less aggressive, while melanoma is rarer but more dangerous due to its ability to spread rapidly. Symptoms often include changes in the appearance of moles or skin lesions, such as irregular borders, multiple colors, or bleeding. Early detection and treatment are crucial for a favorable outcome, with options including surgery, radiation, and in some cases, immunotherapy. Preventative measures include wearing sunscreen and avoiding excessive sun exposure.</div>

      <div class="accordion-body">Breast cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the cells of the breast, most commonly in the ducts (ductal carcinoma) or lobules (lobular carcinoma). It occurs when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably and form a tumor, which can spread to other parts of the body if left untreated. Risk factors include gender (women are at higher risk), age, family history, certain genetic mutations (like BRCA1 and BRCA2), hormone levels, and lifestyle factors. Symptoms often include a lump in the breast, changes in the size or shape of the breast, skin dimpling, or nipple discharge. Early detection through regular screening (like mammograms) is key for better treatment outcomes. Treatment options vary based on the type and stage of cancer and may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy.</div>

      <div class="accordion-body">Lung cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the lungs, often in the cells lining the airways. It is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. There are two main types: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is the most common, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), which is more aggressive and spreads quickly. The primary risk factor for lung cancer is smoking, but non-smokers can also develop the disease due to factors such as exposure to radon, secondhand smoke, pollution, or genetic predisposition. Symptoms may include a persistent cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, coughing up blood, and unexplained weight loss. Early detection is challenging, but screening (like low-dose CT scans) can help in high-risk individuals. Treatment depends on the type and stage of cancer and may involve surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy.</div>

      <div class="accordion-body">Prostate cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in the prostate, a small gland in men responsible for producing seminal fluid. It typically grows slowly and may not cause noticeable symptoms in its early stages. However, in some cases, it can spread to other parts of the body. Risk factors include age (more common in men over 50), family history, race (more prevalent in African American men), and certain genetic mutations. Common symptoms, if they occur, can include difficulty urinating, blood in the urine, pelvic pain, or erectile dysfunction. Prostate cancer is often detected through screening methods such as the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test or a digital rectal exam (DRE). Treatment options depend on the stage of the cancer and may include active surveillance, surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, or chemotherapy. Early detection is crucial for effective management and treatment.</div>

    </h2>

      <div class="accordion-body">Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the cervix, the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. It is primarily caused by persistent infection with high-risk strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually transmitted virus. In many cases, the body’s immune system clears the infection, but in some people, the virus can cause changes in cervical cells that may lead to cancer over time. Early-stage cervical cancer often has no symptoms, but later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, and pain during intercourse. Regular screening through Pap smears and HPV testing can detect precancerous changes in the cervix, allowing for early intervention and treatment. Vaccines are available to protect against the most common cancer-causing strains of HPV. Treatment options for cervical cancer depend on the stage and may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy.</div>

                <h2>The Importance of Awareness</h2>
                <p>
                    Early detection and prevention are key to managing cancer effectively. Through awareness, people can identify the risks, recognize early signs, and seek medical advice. Awareness campaigns can also help reduce the stigma around cancer, provide emotional support to those affected, and encourage healthier lifestyles to reduce the risk of cancer.
